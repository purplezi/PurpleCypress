To do a common thing uncommonly well brings success. The finest steel has to go through the hottest fire. Joy in looking and comprehending is nature's most beautiful gift. We are all in the gutter,but some of us are looking at the stars. No one has a good enough memory to be a successful liar. Yesterday is not ours to recover,but tomorrow is ours to win or lose. Freedom is nothing but a chance to be better. Energy and persistence conquer all things. Cease to struggle and you cease to live. Actions speak louder than words. Knowing something of everything and everything of something. One day,in retrospect,the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful. All that you do,do with your might. Progress is the activity of today and the assurance of tomorrow. We've dominated the planet only because an unparalleled ability to care for one another-for partners,children,families,friends,fellow humans-allowed cooperation on a scale never before seen in the history of life. Get up early.Grind out hardy.Gain on success. The spirit is willing and the flesh is weak. A contented mind is the greatest blessing a man can enjoy in this world. The intrinsic value of education is to maintain a nation's forward momentum.","title":"Every Sentences"}]}
